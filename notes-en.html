      ##Instructor Notes

      #Schedule
      **Important**
      
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!
      
      Please note this schedule is for a single day workshop. If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      #General Notes
      * **Important!**
      Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 - check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have **learner files, Marvel App & Chrome** ready so you can start the experience on time. Encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with installation!
      * If learners don't have access to Marvel app or prefer not to download an app, they can use their paper prototypes for testing.
      * As the workshop has a lot of content, use quick 5-min breaks to give learners time to absorb / ask questions.
      * Give learners a heads-up on forming one group for all activites.
      * Activities 1+2 - For teams that can’t decide on one topic, encourage them to vote using sticky dots/markers on most workable idea out of 3 within the timeframe.
      
      #Specific Examples
      **Slide 10: What is User Experience Design?**
      
      Ask learners what each part means to them. Include some example answers. 
      
      **Slide 11: Where did the term come from?**
      
      Before starting, ask: Any guesses how long the term ‘UX’ has been around?
      Ans: Since 1995!
      
      **Slide 13: What goes into UX?**
      
      Note to learners that this is high level and we will go more into detail later throughout the workshop. 

      **Slide 15: Good and Bad UX Examples**
      
      Ask: Why is this a good or bad experience?
      
      * Mailchimp (Good) - Ensures that you are responsible for your account deletion
      * Facebook (Bad) **How could it be improved?** 
        * Educating user why update is important (e.g. why update, how much time it’ll take, not forcing the update). Forcing update is annoying and could be a life or death situation (urgent msg). 
        
      **Slide 25: How UX and UI compliment each other**
      
      * 1st example: Fishing 2 App = great example of UX/UI. 
        * Ask: Which part is UX, which is UI? 
        * UI: The look and colour, how the fish are moving.
        * UX: The app is convincing enough that the cat (the user) tries to eat the fish.
      * Explain image - Desired path (UX) vs Designed path (UI)
        * Desired path: Represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination
        * UX and UI have to work together to meet user needs. In image, what if the desired path was paved? Would it make the path both UX/UI friendly?
        
      **Slide 27: The Design Cycle**
      
      * Workshop will focus on **Design Sprint** sections.
      
      **Slide 30: Lean UX Method**
      
      Ask: What are the problems with this? (e.g. users might not have a good experience with MVP) 
      
      **Slides 31 - 33: Agile UX Method**
      * Solution:
        * Release to a small amount of people first so you don’t risk losing a lot of customers, e.g. [Spotify’s Discover Weekly](https://labs.spotify.com/2015/11/18/what-made-discover-weekly-one-of-our-most-successful-feature-launches-to-date/)
        
        * Algorithm analyzes person's listening history, focusing on the music they played recently. Compares that insight to the playlisting behavior of others and adds those playlist songs to Discover Weekly.
        * First launched July 2015. Led by Matt Ogle, Product Lead.
        * Tested within spotify team, (length of playlist, music)
        * Team sent out a Google form in the playlist description and over 1500 listeners responded.
        
      **Slide 34**
      
      Ask: How are Agile and Lean methods different?
    
      If no time, explain:
      Agile works **within** Lean, Lean ensures that Agile is scalable (and can be repeated).
      
      **Slide 44: Examples of User Research methods**

      ###Ask / Explain The 5 Whys to learners
      * Eg. Who has a pet peeve? or Who finds online shopping hard?
      * 1st why: Why do you have X pet peeve? Because of M.
      * 2nd why: Why is M making it a pet peeve? Because of N.
      * 3rd why: Why is N a problem? Because of Z.
      * 4th why: Why hasn't Z been resolved?
      * 5th why: Z has not been resolved because... - This is the root cause.

      ###Storytelling or Roleplaying - Following a user journey 
      * What is the first thing you do when you get groceries? Then what? (including things we do unconsciously like grabbing our wallet, locking the door). This is the user journey you take before, during and after getting groceries!

      ###Affinity mapping image (3rd example) is choosing a restaurant
      * Point out briefly how choosing a restaurant includes considerations eg. Price, quality, reviews, speed, delivery.
      
      **Slide 46: Personas**
      
      Ideal number is 5-10 personas (ideal to have more than 1, but we are using this as an example). Can use the methods from slide 44 to build your user personas. 
      
      **Slide 48: Group Activity 1**
      
      These are people you’ll be working with for the rest of the workshop.

      **Slides 53 + 58: Prototyping Activity 3 & 4**
      
      Finalize 4-5 prototype screens. 
      Instructor & Mentors should assist learners on using Marvel.
      
      **Slides 64 - 68: User Testing parts 1 & 2**
      
      Focus on this content and the questions to ask for user testing, since learners will be testing their designs. Part 3 - Wrapping up can be skimmed over quickly.
      
      **Slide 71: Activity 5 - User Testing**
      
      10 mins - Each learner group tests their prototype with their neighbouring group.
      10 mins - Switch after 10 mins. Each group can test with 2 neighbouring groups.
      **Tell learners that they will be wrapping up their findings and nominate 1 volunteer to share during presentation.**
      
      **Slide 75: Presentations**
      
      **Slide 76 - 91: Ethics**
        
      If short on time, jump to slide 83: How does Ethics go with Equity?
        
      **Slide 86: Ethics: What do the following have in common?**
      
      They represent our subconscious biases.
